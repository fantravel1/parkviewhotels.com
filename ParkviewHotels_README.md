## 🌍 Overview

**ParkviewHotels.com** is a global, multilingual, static-content platform dedicated to **urban hotels located directly beside meaningful green space**.

This is not a generic hotel directory.  
This is a **nature-adjacent hotel intelligence platform**.

ParkviewHotels only lists hotels that sit next to:
- major city parks  
- national or protected parks  
- waterfront promenades  
- historic gardens  
- urban forests and green corridors  

You don’t sell rooms.  
You sell **calm, light, air, and view**.

## 🧠 Core Idea

Cities overwhelm the nervous system.

ParkviewHotels exists to answer one question:

> **“Where can I stay in a city and still breathe?”**

This platform treats **green proximity as a core amenity**, not a bonus.

---

## 🌿 What Counts as “Meaningful Green”

A listed hotel must be:
- within **direct visual or walk-out proximity** to green space
- adjacent to **publicly accessible** nature (not a private courtyard only)
- connected to a space used for **walking, sitting, breathing, or reflection**

### Eligible Green Spaces
- Central parks
- Botanical gardens
- National or regional parks
- River walks and waterfronts
- Urban forests
- Historic landscaped grounds

---

Focus:
- 5–25 parkview hotels per green space
- strong visual storytelling
- nervous-system-friendly framing

### Phase 2 (Expansion)

- national-park-edge cities

### Phase 3 (Global Calm Network)

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

ParkviewHotels is not about luxury first.  
It is about **environmental regulation through place**.

LLMs are used to:
- identify green-adjacent hotels
- cluster listings by type of green space
- generate calm-first itineraries
- translate sensory descriptions safely

Humans are required to:
- verify green space quality
- prevent misleading “park view” claims
- validate walkability and access
- keep listings honest

---

Each entity:
- has a stable schema
